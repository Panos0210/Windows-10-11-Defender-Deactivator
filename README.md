# Windows-10-11-Defender-Deactivator
i have made an exe that is basically the deactivator but in case anyone doesnt trust it or whateever ive uploaded the original file too so its open source and u can check the code or even make the exe urself with auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe) or any other tool

## also the program is made to be used on medium pcs and not the one with the hdd that was built in the early 2000s just to clear that out but even if u have one of them and it takes a bit longer to open windows defender (the app) in the code where it is says "time.sleep(5)" (line 8 also number example 3 = 3 secs and 0.5 = 0.5 secs) change the number for a higher number so it will suit u and the follow the auto-py-to-exe method

### if u want it to run faster the just remove to time.sleep(0.3) (line 4) or change the time.sleep(5) (line 8) that was added to support all pcs, the line 4 method will only work on windows 10 if u remove that line bc the program was made for windows 11 and just supports windows 10 too
