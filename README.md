# Windows-10-11-Defender-Deactivator
i have made an exe that is basically the deactivator but in case anyone doesnt trust it or whateever ive uploaded the original file too so its open source and u can check the code or even make the exe urself with auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe) or any other tool

also the program is made to be used on medium pcs and not the one with the hdd that was built in the early 2000s just to clear that out but even if u have one of them and it takes a bit longer time to open windows defender (the app) in the code where it is written "time.sleep(5)" (line 8) change the number for a higher number so it will suit u and the follow the auto-py-to-exe method
